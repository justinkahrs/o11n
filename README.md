## 🧩 What is o11n?

**o11n** (pronounced *“oh-eleven-en”*, short for *orchestration*) is a desktop app that lets you **load your project files**, **write natural language instructions**, and **apply AI-generated code changes directly** to your source files — safely and interactively.

No API keys.  
No login.  
No subscriptions (for personal use).

Think of it as:  
> “Tell the AI what you want, see what it suggests, then apply the edits to your project — instantly.”

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🗂 **Load your codebase** — Give the AI full context by loading one or more files or an entire project.  
- 💬 **Prompt naturally** — Type instructions like “Add a dark mode” or “Refactor my user auth logic.”  
- ⚙️ **AI-driven changes** — The AI proposes edits and new files. You approve before applying.  
- 🧠 **Context-aware** — Include documentation, configs, and related files to inform the model.  
- 🔁 **Iterate quickly** — Apply, reload, and prompt again to refine results.  
- 💾 **Save prompts** — Keep and reuse your favorite commands or workflows.  
- 🪶 **No friction** — Works offline. No setup or external API credentials needed.

## 🎯 Who It’s For

- **Non-coders** who want to build things without learning every syntax detail.  
- **Beginner devs** who want a low-friction environment to explore and learn.  
- **Experienced engineers** who are tired of repetitive edits or big refactors.  
- **Creative tinkerers** — writers, designers, researchers, and “kids who climb on rocks.”  

If you want to *build, explore, and play with your ideas*, o11n is for you.

## 🛠️ What You Can Do

- Edit or refactor many files at once  
- Find and fix bugs across your project  
- Generate new components, routes, or utilities  
- Analyze and transform datasets  
- Maintain design or naming consistency  
- Work with creative or writing projects (not just code!)  
- “Chat” with your files to uncover structure or meaning

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Load your project** — select files or folders.  
2. **Describe your goal** — type what you want to happen.  
3. **Review AI output** — see proposed code or changes.  
4. **Apply safely** — approve to write changes directly.  
5. **Iterate** — repeat with more context or refined prompts.
