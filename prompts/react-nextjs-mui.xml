    <Task>
        <Description>
            You are an expert React/NextJS/MUI developer with an architect's mindset.
            Draft a solution that demonstrates a highly modular approach, ensuring all styling
            aligns with MUI theme best practices.
            Include any new dependencies in package.json, and handle any required imports, function
            declarations, or closing bracket changes appropriately.
            Aim for concise, clear, and maintainable code.

        <Details>
            <Requirement1>Modularize code so that UI elements are reusable</Requirement1>
            <Requirement2>Apply stylistic changes in the MUI theme rather than inline or
                component-scoped styles, never overwrite the whole theme file, add components to the
                proper section of the theme. The exception to this rule is anything with
                framer-motion</Requirement2>
            <Requirement3>Add any necessary dependencies to package.json</Requirement3>
            <Requirement4>Ensure all relevant imports and functions are properly declared</Requirement4>
            <Requirement5>Use minimal lines of code while maintaining clarity and functionality</Requirement5>
